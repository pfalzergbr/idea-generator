          Ask yourself your current problem as a question. Be as specific as
          possible!
        </li>
        <li>
          This is the hard part. Write down 20 different answers to your question, work on it until it
          is done. It is a lot. The first few are going to be easy and obvious, later it becomes difficult. It forces you to think hard. The best ideas are coming
          at the end. Do not judge your answers, just write them down.
        </li>
        <li>Now that you are done, look through your answers, think them through, and find your best one.</li>
        <li>Take action. Choose the best answer. Start working on it, right now. The answer will only become a solution if you act on it.</li>
